### Work Experience
* **CEO and Co-founder** <span style="font-size:smaller;">[Jan 2022 - Current]</span>  
X23D AG&reg; (Zurich, Switzerland)  
Through our academic research work at [ROCS](https://rocs.balgrist.ch/en/), X23D&reg; has been founded as a startup focusing on delivering the next generation of surgical navigation solutions based on our recent advancements in the filed of AI-based 3D anatomical reconstruction. We have secured seed funding that has allowed us to pursue our research and development activities in the first phase of our product development roadmap.  
Full time employees: 2 software developers | Academic research: 1 PhD candidate, 2 M.Sc. Students.

* **Group Head - Artificial Intelligence Research** <span style="font-size:smaller;">[Sep 2020 - Current]</span>  
[Research in Orthopedic Computer Science Lab](https://rocs.balgrist.ch/en/), [Balgrist University Hospital](https://www.balgrist.ch/en/) (Zurich, Switzerland)  
Supervision and management of the research projects related to the application of artificial intelligence for computer-assisted surgery. My activities cover: technical supervision, project time and milestone management, experimental supervision and scientific writing support and feedback.  
Direct supervision: 1 PhD candidate, 3 M.Sc. students, 2 medical residents | Co-supervision: 5 PhD candidates.

* **Post-doctoral Fellow** <span style="font-size:smaller;">[Sep 2020 - Jun 2022]</span>  
[Research in Orthopedic Computer Science Lab](https://rocs.balgrist.ch/en/), [Balgrist University Hospital](https://www.balgrist.ch/en/) (Zurich, Switzerland)  
Research topics: AI-based intraoperative reconstruction using sparse multi-view fluoroscopy, the application of deep reinforcement learning algorithms for preoperative and intraoperative surgical planning, real-time intraoperative vertebral registration and surgical tool tracking using RGB-D sensors, surgical process modelling of open spinal surgeries, intraoperative tissue classification, brain-computer interface for intraoperative image control, augmented reality-based surgical navigation and guidance for spinal decompression interventions. 

* **Post-doctoral Fellow** <span style="font-size:smaller;">[Jun 2020 - Aug 2020]</span>  
[Surgical Technologies Lab](https://stl.mech.ubc.ca/), [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (Vancouver, Canada)  
Research topic: I worked on surgical navigation method tailored to mandibular reconstruction surgeries. An optimization routine was designed and implemented to assist the planning and the execution of the intervention (positioning the mandibular and fibular cutting planes). I also coordinated and integrated software contributions from other group members towards a central software solution.

* **Industrial Internship** <span style="font-size:smaller;">[Nov 2013 - Nov 2014]</span>  
[Tangent Design Engineering](https://www.tangentservices.com/) (Calgary, Alberta)  
Project: Project: the application of optical flow sensors for C-arm base tracking and positioning.
